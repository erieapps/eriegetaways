The living room space was comfortable to relax in and the beds were comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with enough for us to cook a nice summer meal and it was great to have the option to use the washer/drier as needed. The neighborhood was quiet but so close to so many great restaurants and points of interest. Would love to stay again.
